# MongoDB ðŸš€

This was my first time using MongoDB together with Express and Node.js.  
I used Postman to create and send API request to test the routes.   


During this exercise, I learned about setting up a new MongoDB project and I also gained a better understanding of the interactions between the server and database.


Example of how i used Postman:
